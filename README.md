## Summary of each role:

#### Consulting (heckadecimal)

Consulting with tech companies to iterate on existing projects as well as bring new ideas, products, and services to life all the way from the design and planning stages through to fully functional deployments at global scale that're robust, secure, well-tested, well-documented, accessible, and that empower people to solve the problems they care about, easier.

In particular, I enjoy making tools that are useful to people regardless of their skill level or any differences in ability.

I've created and worked on everything from user interfaces, to API's and middleware, to CLI's and services, mobile and native apps, video games, embedded systems, network programming, databases, AI systems, and various other projects- both on my own and across many teams, as an IC, and as a team lead, not only to create excellent software but to do so on time or ahead of schedule, and while fostering a fun and engaging work environment for everyone involved.

---

#### Kaiju Keyboards

Created a website to make blog posts about the company's progress, and list custom keyboards for sale (using sveltekit and Node.js). I also created firmware using mostly C (and some Rust) for ESP32/ESP8266 microcontrollers, integrating with QMK/VIA to not only handle input from keys, but also input from fully integrated trackballs that control the cursor with no configuration required out of the box, and to handle other input mechanisms as well, like rotary encoders and faders/sliders.

Frequently helped solve physical design challenges with the founder (who was the hardware expert) and helped come up with and implement solutions related to PCB design, general layout, 3D modeling and printing, and fabrication.

---

#### Astronomer

Contributed primarily to astro UI, a react app (with typescript) for managing all of your big data jobs using apache airflow, and contributed to the backend services and API's in GO and Node.js that power it. Within my first month I brought test coverage up from 0% to over 50%. In addition to regular feature work and bug fixes, I also onboarded and mentored several other engineers, and consistently drove progress towards better patterns dealing with accessibility, security, and developer experience.

---

#### Consulting

Started out by working with local small businesses to get them set up with custom websites, and created internal software to help automate repetitive tasks for business owners. After that I worked with several tech companies and startups to make their codebases compliant with things like WCAG, SOC2/SOC3, and other useful standards, while helping to scale existing products and services to support millions of simultaneous users, and beyond.

---

#### Puppet

Contributed primarily to the Puppet Enterprise Console (a web interface for managing all the nodes in your puppet ecosystem) and the backend services, API's, and middleware that it depends on. During my time here, I learned several new languages including Clojure and Rust, to be able to contribute to more areas of the stack. I also helped to make hiring decisions and onboard new team members.

---

#### Wevaya

Was the lead engineer and co-founder, built an entire social media site frontend and backend (using angular, node with express, and mongoDB) designed to facilitate people helping each other reach their goals. I worked closely with the other cofounders to define, plan, implement, test, and ship the project, but I wrote all the code myself.

---

#### 1 Little Designer

Built themes and plugins for Rapidweaver, mostly focused on frontend work. I would come up with my own ideas for plugins and themes, pitch them to the founders, receive feedback from them, and implement my own ideas in a self-directed manner. I also handled all the customer feedback on products that I created, fixing bugs and adding new features as needed.
